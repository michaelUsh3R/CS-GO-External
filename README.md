# CS-GO-External

A major flaw in the video game industry is how video games are vulnerable to being modified through memory manipulation. Memory manipulation poses a threat to competitive online gaming because it allows for users to position themselves at an unfair advantage, violating the integrity of having a fair competitive environment. CS-GO-External has been designed to show how memory may be exploited and manipulated in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive. CS-GO-External has been developed for the sole intention of educational purposes.
